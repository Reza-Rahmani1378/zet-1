# Identify Resources in Building API

It's common to describe resources as plural nouns, like ```customers```,
```events```, or ```transactions```. As you identify different resources
in your web service, youâ€™ll build out a list of nouns that describe the
different data users can manage in the API. make sure to consider any
nested resources. For example, customers may have sales, or events may
contain guests. Establishing these resource hierarchies will help when
you define API endpoints.
