# Remove string whitespace 

All the following methods will remove whitespace from the string by
create and return new string objects rather than modify the strings line

* lstrip() - remove whitespace from the start
* rstrip() - remove whitespace from the end
* strip()	- remove all whitespaces

**Note:** Tabs, space character, carriage returns, and line feeds
consider as whitespace

**Note:** All strip methods remove anything you pass them as an
argument, if you don't pass them anything they will remove only
whitespaces.
