# ```shadow``` and ```password``` file
A shadow password file, also known as /etc/shadow, is a system file in
Linux that stores encrypted user passwords and is accessible only to the
root user, preventing unauthorized users or malicious actors from
breaking into the system.

In older Linux systems, user information, including passwords and
usernames, are kept in a system file called /etc/passwd. This plaintext
database is used to keep track of every user on the Linux system. The
file is owned by the root and can only be modified by root or users with
sudo privileges, although it is readable by all system users.
