# Substring processes in python

To check if the substring exist in our string, use the following conditions, it returns 'True' or 'False'

```python
SUBSTRING in STRING
SUBSTRING not in STRING
```

To find the  index first character of SUBSTRING we can use ```find```
and ```index``` methods. The former returns -1 if it cannot find the
substring, the later retruns error.

```python
STRING.find('SUBSTRING')
```
Other useful methods:
* startwith()
* endwith()
