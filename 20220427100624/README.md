# When use LDAP in an organization

If an organization is having trouble deciding when to use LDAP, they should consider it in a few use cases. They should
consider it if:
  * a single piece of data needs to be found and accessed regularly;
  * the organization has a lot of smaller data entries;
  * the organization wants all smaller pieces of data in one centralized location, and there doesn't need to be an extreme
    amount of organization between the data.
